# IT358 CHN Lab

To run this locally:
# Prerequisites

Ensure you have mkdocs installed. This can be done with:

```
pip install mkdocs
```

# Making changes

Fork a copy to your own repo, then clone it locally. Make any edits you wish to edit. To see what your edits look like, run:

```
mkdocs serve
```

In the same directory as your mkdocs.yml file. This will spin up a local web server for you to view what the docs look like. Make sure you’re satisfied with your edits.

Once you’re happy with the content and layout, commit and push to your repo.

Then, make a pull request back to the main repo, and request a review (or wait till someone notices).
