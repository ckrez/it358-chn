Setting Up Logging for Honeypot Data
====================================

## Connect to the CHN Server Host
If you do not already have an SSH session established with your CHN Server, SSH into your CHN Server instance.

On Mac/Linux:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 4222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER} 
```
On Windows:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 4222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER}
```

## Create hpfeeds-logger.sysconfig

Like when starting CHN Server, simply run the following commands:

```bash
cd /opt/chnserver && python3 guided_docker_compose.py
```

Answer "n" when asked about reconfiguring CHN Server.

Answer "n" when asked about logging to a remote CIFv3 server.

Answer "y" when asked about logging to a local file.

Answer "n" when asked about enable intelligence feeds from a CIFv3 server. 

Fill in "json" for the Logging Format

```text
Previous chn-server.sysconfig file detected. Do you wish to reconfigure? [y/N]: n
Do you wish to enable logging to a remote CIFv3 server? [y/N]: n
Do you wish to enable logging to a local file? [y/N]: y

splunk: Comma delimited key/value logging format for use with Splunk
json: JSON formatted log format
arcsight: Log format for use with ArcSight SIEM appliances
json_raw: Raw JSON output from hpfeeds. More verbose that other formats, but also not normalized. Can generate a large amount of data.
Logging Format: splunk
Wrote file to config/sysconfig/hpfeeds-logger.sysconfig
```

## Start the hpfeeds-logger container

Start the hpfeeds-logger container with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d hpfeeds-logger
```

## Checking your setup
You should now have a new directory `/opt/chnserver/storage/hpfeeds-logs`. List this directory to see a new file, chn.log:

```bash
ls -l /opt/chnserver/storage/hpfeeds-logs
```

You can show the contents of this file with the `cat` command:

```bash
cat /opt/chnserver/storage/hpfeeds-logs/chn.log
```
Your file may be empty at the moment. To test your honeypot, we can simulate an attack by trying to log into our new 
honeypot using SSH to port 2222. 

## Test your honeypot
Open a new terminal tab/window, and export your team number again; for example if your team number is 50:
```bash
export TEAM=50
```

Now, attempt to connect to the honeypot SSH port to trigger an alert:

On Mac/Linux:
```bash
ssh -l attacker -p 2222 ${GROUP HP SERVER}  
```
On Windows:
```bash
ssh -l attacker -p 2222 ${GROUP HP SERVER}  
```

If you're using Putty, you can use the "Load" button for your normal workshop-chn-hp connection, and change the port 
before connecting to simulate an attack.

You can now `cat /opt/chnserver/storage/hpfeeds-logs/chn.log` the log file again, and you should see data about your 
attempt to log in.
