Set Up Logging to CIFv3
=======================

## Configuring logging to CIFv3

If you do not already have an SSH session established with your workshop-chn-server, SSH into your CHN Server instance.

On Mac/Linux:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 4222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER}
```
On Windows:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 4222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER} 
```

## Updating CHN Server to log to CIFv3

Like when starting CHN Server, simply run the following commands:

```bash
cd /opt/chnserver && python3 guided_docker_compose.py
```

Answer "n" when asked about reconfiguring CHN Server.

When you reach the question about enabling CIFv3, answer 'Y'.

Enter the provided information for the CIF host URL, including the "https" portion:

```text
${CIF SERVER}
```

Enter the provided API Token.


Also be sure to update the CIF_PROVIDER field to "group-NUMBER", where `NUMBER` is the group number you were assigned.

```text
Previous chn-server.sysconfig file detected. Do you wish to reconfigure? [Y/n]: n
Do you wish to enable logging to a remote CIFv3 server? [Y/n]: Y
Please enter the URL for the remote CIFv3 server: ${CIF SERVER}
Please enter the API token for the remote CIFv3 server: ${CIF TOKEN}
Please enter a name you wish to be associated with your organization: group-${GROUP}
Wrote file to config/sysconfig/hpfeeds-cif.sysconfig
Previous hpfeeds-logger.sysconfig file detected. Do you wish to reconfigure? [y/N]: n
```

## Start the hpfeeds-cif container

Start hpfeeds-cif container with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d hpfeeds-cif
```

## Test your CIF install

Please generate another honeypot event to ensure there's data to find.

Open a new terminal tab/window, and export your team number again; for example if your team number is 50:


Now, attempt to connect to the honeypot SSH port:

On Mac/Linux:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 2222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER}
```
On Windows:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 2222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER}
```

Now examine the hpfeeds-cif logs to see if you see a new event:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=10 hpfeeds-cif
```

## Installing CIF Tools
Seeing that data is submitted via logs is handy, but not very useful for using the data. We'll install the CIF SDK, 
which provides some command line tools for selecting, retrieving, and formatting data from a CIF server.

For this workshop, weâ€™ll install the CIFv3 tools onto the CHN Server system, but the SDK can be installed on any 
Linux system. 

Begin by SSHing into the CHN Server host:

On Mac/Linux:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 4222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER}
```
On Windows:
```bash
ssh -l ubuntu -p 4222 ${GROUP CHN SERVER}
```

Once connected, install the CIFv3 pip package:

```bash 
sudo apt install python-pip -y && sudo pip install 'cifsdk>=3.0.0,<4.0'
```

Next you need to create a new file, `/home/ubuntu/.cif.yml`, with the following contents. Remember to use either nano
 or vim to create this file:

Create the file:
```bash
nano /home/ubuntu/.cif.yml
```

Then paste in these contents:
```yaml
token: <same value as CIF_TOKEN>
remote: ${CIF SERVER URL}
no_verify_ssl: true
```
Now hit `Ctrl-X` to quit, answer `y` to save, and hit enter to keep your filename.

You can now verify that you can connect to the CIF instance with the SDK using the following command:

```bash
cif -p
```
Which, when correctly configured and working properly, will return results like:
```bash
roundtrip: 0.115531921387 ms
roundtrip: 0.0400021076202 ms
roundtrip: 0.0375020503998 ms
roundtrip: 0.0692510604858 ms
```

## Querying CIF
Now you can search for the entry you generated earlier, looking for your provider name with the following command. Be
 sure to substitute your group number in the provider field. For instance, if you're group number was 2:
 
```bash
cif --tags honeypot --itype ipv4 --last-hour --provider group-2
```

Trying again without the `--provider` option will show you any other submissions from your classmates!

```bash
cif --tags honeypot --itype ipv4 --last-hour
```
